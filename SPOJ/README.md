# SPOJ-Challenging-Problems
A repository where I post my SPOJ codes

Please refer https://www.spoj.com to understand the codes. Some codes do not have comments mentioning the aim of them. I have named all codes by their question title though.

Disclaimer: Please DO NOT copy the code as a whole. I do not mean to give away the answers but just guide the noobies who can't figure out the codes on their own. Please only understand the code, and then implement the same on your own. It will be "SAFE" and "BENEFICIAL" for you and me both.
