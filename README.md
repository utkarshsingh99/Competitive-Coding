# Codechef-Problems
This is a repository where I post my accepted solutions of codechef problems.

Currently, the problems are of Beginner and Easy level only. I hope by the beginning of 2018, I'll start posting problems of Medium and Hard levels. 

Disclaimer: Please DO NOT copy the code as a whole. I do not mean to give away the answers but just guide the noobies who can't figure out the codes on their own. Please only understand the code, and then implement the same on your own. It will be "SAFE" and "BENEFICIAL" for you and me both.
